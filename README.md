I began this test with 0 knowledge of C#. I was able to make the GET request and use regular expressions to idenfity correct formatting, however I wasn't able to properly deserialise the JSON file provided by the API. This was largely due to the JSON file's root structure; the NewtonSoft deserialiser couldn't seem make sense of it. Given more time, I would've studied the structure of the JSON further and implement a `foreach` loop which would drill down to each required data object, as well as `try`-`catch` exeception to check the validilty of the ISO itself. 


Time taken: 3 hours, including learning syntax.
